## 📖 Overview

**Hermes Bot** is a production-grade, always-on AI agent that runs entirely on Render's free tier and talks to you through Telegram. Under the hood, it's powered by the [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch) framework from Nous Research, routed to **Claude Haiku 4.5** through **NaraRouter**, and engineered to survive the two things that usually kill free-tier bots: **ephemeral storage** and **strict rate limits**.

Instead of losing its memory every time Render spins the container down, Hermes Bot automatically backs itself up to a private Supabase bucket every 30 seconds — and restores itself the moment it wakes back up. No paid database. No lost conversations. No manual intervention.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🗨️ **Native Telegram Integration** — Full two-way conversation via long-polling, with an allow-list of authorized user IDs for privacy and access control.
- 🧠 **Claude Haiku 4.5 Intelligence** — Fast, cost-efficient reasoning accessed through NaraRouter's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, configured as a custom Hermes provider.
- 💾 **Zero-Cost Persistent Memory (Supabase Auto-Backup/Restore)** — Solves Render's ephemeral filesystem problem entirely for free:
  - On container **startup**, the agent downloads and restores the latest `.hermes` state archive from a private Supabase Storage bucket.
  - A lightweight background loop **zips and uploads** the local state directory (SQLite DB + Markdown memory files) every 30 seconds using nothing but `shutil` and `curl` — no extra dependencies.
- 🔁 **Rate-Limit Resiliency** — Custom retry logic (`api_max_retries`, `retry_backoff_base`) tuned specifically to gracefully absorb NaraRouter's 10 requests/minute ceiling without dropping messages.
- 🐳 **Single-Container Docker Deployment** — One `Dockerfile`, one `entrypoint.sh`, zero infrastructure headaches.
- 🆓 **100% Free-Tier Stack** — Render (free web service) + Supabase (free storage bucket) + NaraRouter (free model access). No credit card required to run this project.

## 🧩 Prerequisites & Requirements

Before deploying, make sure you have the following ready:

### 1. Telegram Bot
- Open Telegram and message **[@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)**
- Run `/newbot`, follow the prompts, and save the **Bot Token** it gives you
- Get your numeric Telegram user ID from **[@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)** — this goes into `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` so only you can control the agent

### 2. Supabase Private Storage Bucket
- Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- Go to **Storage** → **New Bucket**
- Name it exactly **`hermes`** and set it to **Private**
- From **Project Settings → API**, copy your **Project URL** and **Service Role Key** (needed for read/write access to a private bucket)

### 3. NaraRouter API Key
- Sign up at [router.naraya.ai](https://router.naraya.ai)
- Generate an API key from your dashboard
- Confirm `claude-haiku-4.5` (or your chosen model) is available on your plan/tier

### 4. Accounts
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account (to host this repo)
- A [Render](https://render.com) account (free tier is sufficient)

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Set these under **Render → Your Service → Environment** (never commit them directly to a public repo):

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `NARA_API_KEY` | API key for NaraRouter, used to access Claude Haiku 4.5 | `sk-nara-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token issued by BotFather for your bot | `123456789:AAExxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` | Comma-separated Telegram user ID(s) allowed to use the bot | `7215592040` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL | `https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co` |
| `SUPABASE_KEY` | Supabase service role key (private bucket read/write access) | `eyJhbGciOi...` |

---

## 🚀 Deployment on Render (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1 — Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Hermes Bot"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/SahinShazi/hermes-bot.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2 — Create a New Web Service on Render
1. Log in to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click **New +** → **Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository
4. Render will auto-detect the `Dockerfile` — choose **Docker** as the environment

### Step 3 — Configure the Service
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `hermes-bot` (or your preferred name) |
| **Region** | Closest to you |
| **Branch** | `main` |
| **Runtime** | Docker |
| **Instance Type** | Free |

### Step 4 — Add Environment Variables
In the **Environment** tab, add all five variables listed in the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section above.

### Step 5 — Set the Port
Render requires an open HTTP port to detect a healthy service on the free tier. This project starts a lightweight dummy HTTP server automatically — Render will inject the `PORT` variable and the app binds to it automatically. No manual port configuration is required.

### Step 6 — Deploy
Click **Create Web Service**. Render will build the Docker image and deploy it. Watch the **Logs** tab for:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           ⚕ Hermes Gateway Starting...                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Messaging platforms + cron scheduler                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
Once you see this, open Telegram and message your bot. 🎉

> 💡 **Tip:** Render's free tier spins down idle services. The first message after inactivity may take 30–60 seconds to respond as the container restores its state from Supabase — this is expected behavior.

## ⚙️ How the Persistence Layer Works

```
┌──────────────────┐        restore on boot        ┌────────────────────┐
│  Supabase Bucket │ ─────────────────────────────▶ │   Render Container │
│   ("hermes")     │                                │   /root/.hermes/   │
│                  │ ◀───────────────────────────── │                    │
└──────────────────┘     upload every 30 seconds    └────────────────────┘
```

1. **On startup:** `restore.sh` pulls the most recent backup archive from the private Supabase bucket and extracts it into `/root/.hermes/`.
2. **While running:** a background loop zips the entire `.hermes/` directory and uploads it via `curl` to Supabase every 30 seconds, overwriting the previous backup.
3. **On restart/redeploy:** even though Render wipes the container's disk, the next boot cycle simply restores from Supabase — so conversations, memory, and state survive indefinitely at zero additional cost.

## 🛡️ Rate-Limit Handling

NaraRouter's free tier enforces a **10 requests/minute** cap. Rather than failing on the first `429`, Hermes is configured to retry patiently:

```yaml
api_max_retries: 6
retry_backoff_base: 10.0
```

This gives the agent up to 6 retry attempts with exponential backoff starting at 10 seconds — smoothing over rate-limit spikes without dropping user messages or throwing errors mid-conversation.
